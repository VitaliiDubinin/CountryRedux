# That project made during an education.

that is clone of my CountryApp, refactoring to Redux

- git clone https://github.com/VitaliiDubinin/CountryApp.git
- npm install
- npm start

## add React and Toolkit

npm install redux react-redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm i axios

### Please take into accout, that project has not finished yet, I'm trying to conbine different features. It works for assignment. All main function work: countries, favorites, singlecard page. and some extras. For doing little bit easy to read a cose - see the files with .jsx extensions in "components" folder.
